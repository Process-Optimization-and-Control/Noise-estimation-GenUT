class UnscentedKalmanFilterConstrained(object):
    # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes

    r"""
    Implements the Scaled Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as defined by
    Simon Julier in [1], using the formulation provided by Wan and Merle
    in [2]. This filter scales the sigma points to avoid strong nonlinearities.


    Parameters
    ----------

    dim_x : int
        Number of state variables for the filter. For example, if
        you are tracking the position and velocity of an object in two
        dimensions, dim_x would be 4.


    dim_z : int
        Number of of measurement inputs. For example, if the sensor
        provides you with position in (x,y), dim_z would be 2.

        This is for convience, so everything is sized correctly on
        creation. If you are using multiple sensors the size of `z` can
        change based on the sensor. Just provide the appropriate hx function


    dt : float
        Time between steps in seconds.



    hx : function(x,**hx_args)
        Measurement function. Converts state vector x into a measurement
        vector of shape (dim_z).

    fx : function(x,dt,**fx_args)
        function that returns the state x transformed by the
        state transition function. dt is the time step in seconds.

    points : class
        Class which computes the sigma points and weights for a UKF
        algorithm. You can vary the UKF implementation by changing this
        class. For example, MerweScaledSigmaPoints implements the alpha,
        beta, kappa parameterization of Van der Merwe, and
        JulierSigmaPoints implements Julier's original kappa
        parameterization. See either of those for the required
        signature of this class if you want to implement your own.

    sqrt_fn : callable(ndarray), default=None (implies scipy.linalg.cholesky)
        Defines how we compute the square root of a matrix, which has
        no unique answer. Cholesky is the default choice due to its
        speed. Typically your alternative choice will be
        scipy.linalg.sqrtm. Different choices affect how the sigma points
        are arranged relative to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
        Usually this will not matter to you; if so the default cholesky()
        yields maximal performance. As of van der Merwe's dissertation of
        2004 [6] this was not a well reseached area so I have no advice
        to give you.

        If your method returns a triangular matrix it must be upper
        triangular. Do not use numpy.linalg.cholesky - for historical
        reasons it returns a lower triangular matrix. The SciPy version
        does the right thing as far as this class is concerned.

    x_mean_fn : callable  (sigma_points, weights), optional
        Function that computes the mean of the provided sigma points
        and weights. Use this if your state variable contains nonlinear
        values such as angles which cannot be summed.

        .. code-block:: Python

            def state_mean(sigmas, Wm):
                x = np.zeros(3)
                sum_sin, sum_cos = 0., 0.

                for i in range(len(sigmas)):
                    s = sigmas[i]
                    x[0] += s[0] * Wm[i]
                    x[1] += s[1] * Wm[i]
                    sum_sin += sin(s[2])*Wm[i]
                    sum_cos += cos(s[2])*Wm[i]
                x[2] = atan2(sum_sin, sum_cos)
                return x

    z_mean_fn : callable  (sigma_points, weights), optional
        Same as x_mean_fn, except it is called for sigma points which
        form the measurements after being passed through hx().

    residual_x : callable (x, y), optional
    residual_z : callable (x, y), optional
        Function that computes the residual (difference) between x and y.
        You will have to supply this if your state variable cannot support
        subtraction, such as angles (359-1 degreees is 2, not 358). x and y
        are state vectors, not scalars. One is for the state variable,
        the other is for the measurement state.

        .. code-block:: Python

            def residual(a, b):
                y = a[0] - b[0]
                if y > np.pi:
                    y -= 2*np.pi
                if y < -np.pi:
                    y += 2*np.pi
                return y

    state_add: callable (x, y), optional, default np.add
        Function that subtracts two state vectors, returning a new
        state vector. Used during update to compute `x + K@y`
        You will have to supply this if your state variable does not
        suport addition, such as it contains angles.

    Attributes
    ----------

    x : numpy.array(dim_x)
        state estimate vector

    P : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        covariance estimate matrix

    x_prior : numpy.array(dim_x)
        Prior (predicted) state estimate. The *_prior and *_post attributes
        are for convienence; they store the  prior and posterior of the
        current epoch. Read Only.

    P_prior : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        Prior (predicted) state covariance matrix. Read Only.

    x_post : numpy.array(dim_x)
        Posterior (updated) state estimate. Read Only.

    P_post : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        Posterior (updated) state covariance matrix. Read Only.

    z : ndarray
        Last measurement used in update(). Read only.

    R : numpy.array(dim_z, dim_z)
        measurement noise matrix

    Q : numpy.array(dim_x, dim_x)
        process noise matrix

    K : numpy.array
        Kalman gain

    y : numpy.array
        innovation residual

    log_likelihood : scalar
        Log likelihood of last measurement update.

    likelihood : float
        likelihood of last measurment. Read only.

        Computed from the log-likelihood. The log-likelihood can be very
        small,  meaning a large negative value such as -28000. Taking the
        exp() of that results in 0.0, which can break typical algorithms
        which multiply by this value, so by default we always return a
        number >= sys.float_info.min.

    mahalanobis : float
        mahalanobis distance of the measurement. Read only.

    inv : function, default numpy.linalg.inv
        If you prefer another inverse function, such as the Moore-Penrose
        pseudo inverse, set it to that instead:

        .. code-block:: Python

            kf.inv = np.linalg.pinv


    Examples
    --------

    Simple example of a linear order 1 kinematic filter in 2D. There is no
    need to use a UKF for this example, but it is easy to read.

    >>> def fx(x, dt):
    >>>     # state transition function - predict next state based
    >>>     # on constant velocity model x = vt + x_0
    >>>     F = np.array([[1, dt, 0, 0],
    >>>                   [0, 1, 0, 0],
    >>>                   [0, 0, 1, dt],
    >>>                   [0, 0, 0, 1]], dtype=float)
    >>>     return np.dot(F, x)
    >>>
    >>> def hx(x):
    >>>    # measurement function - convert state into a measurement
    >>>    # where measurements are [x_pos, y_pos]
    >>>    return np.array([x[0], x[2]])
    >>>
    >>> dt = 0.1
    >>> # create sigma points to use in the filter. This is standard for Gaussian processes
    >>> points = MerweScaledSigmaPoints(4, alpha=.1, beta=2., kappa=-1)
    >>>
    >>> kf = UnscentedKalmanFilter(dim_x=4, dim_z=2, dt=dt, fx=fx, hx=hx, points=points)
    >>> kf.x = np.array([-1., 1., -1., 1]) # initial state
    >>> kf.P *= 0.2 # initial uncertainty
    >>> z_std = 0.1
    >>> kf.R = np.diag([z_std**2, z_std**2]) # 1 standard
    >>> kf.Q = Q_discrete_white_noise(dim=2, dt=dt, var=0.01**2, block_size=2)
    >>>
    >>> zs = [[i+randn()*z_std, i+randn()*z_std] for i in range(50)] # measurements
    >>> for z in zs:
    >>>     kf.predict()
    >>>     kf.update(z)
    >>>     print(kf.x, 'log-likelihood', kf.log_likelihood)

        Parameters
        ----------

        zs : list-like
            list of measurements at each time step `self._dt` Missing
            measurements must be represented by 'None'.

        Rs : None, np.array or list-like, default=None
            optional list of values to use for the measurement error
            covariance R.

            If Rs is None then self.R is used for all epochs.

            If it is a list of matrices or a 3D array where
            len(Rs) == len(zs), then it is treated as a list of R values, one
            per epoch. This allows you to have varying R per epoch.

        dts : None, scalar or list-like, default=None
            optional value or list of delta time to be passed into predict.

            If dtss is None then self.dt is used for all epochs.

            called after every epoch

        Returns
        -------
